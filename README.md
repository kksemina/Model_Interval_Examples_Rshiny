Exploring differences between confidence and prediction intervals and when each is best used using R shiny App. 

https://kseniasemina.shinyapps.io/Intervals/

This application is designed to provide a comprehensive exploration of confidence and prediction intervals within the framework of a linear regression model, using the mtcars dataset in R.

Essentially, it's a tool that facilitates a clear understanding of the distinctions between confidence and prediction intervals. Confidence intervals offer insights into the certainty surrounding the average value, drawing upon historical or current data. In contrast, prediction intervals cast a gaze into the future, enabling predictions of individual values.

To make the most of this application, simply adjust the sliders on the left to fine-tune the levels of confidence and prediction according to your specific requirements.
